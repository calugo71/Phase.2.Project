            <div className='contact-stuff' >About Us:
                <p className='contact-stuff'>  Brandon and Carlos started rescuing dogs in late 2021. Our main goal was to get these dogs off the street and in loving homes.
                    We created this company app to allow people who have found dogs, or wish to put theirs up for adoption.
                    The company started with just two people. Now, in 2022 we have over 25 team members and 3 locations.
                    This is a non-profit organization that fully functions off our members and donations for the food and shelter we provide.
